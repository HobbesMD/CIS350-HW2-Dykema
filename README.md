#### Hobbies
- I love playing Disc Golf. I play multiple times a week 8-9 months out the year. I also play multiple tournaments every year in the highest amateur division. 
- I also love to cook and do it often. I make some mean tacos, grill a good burger, and make a delicious breakfast sandwhich with bacon, pesto, egg, cheese, and honey.
- My wife and I enjoy camping and hiking together often. We have been visiting camp sites all around Michigan over the past year. This past spring we bought and converted a Ford Transit Connect into a little camper to use for our travels.

#### Techinical Background
I currently work as a Software Automation Engineer at a company in Belmont. I have been with them for 2.5 years and have gained experience with C#, RESTful APIs, Windows Services, MongoDB, SQL, SSRS, JavaScript, React, and more. Academically, I have taken a few programming classes in C++ and Java mostly.
